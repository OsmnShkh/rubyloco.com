        About Ruby LoCo
      %p 
        RubyLoCo was formed in 2012 to gather the great ruby minds of Loudoun County.  We welcome all technologists, but focus our group on discussions relating to Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, and other related web disciplines.  

      %p
        Ruby LoCo meets for lunch and afternoon hacking on the last Friday of every month.  Ruby LoCo also meets twice a month for hack night at the #{link_to "BusyConf", "http://www.busyconf.com" } offices.
